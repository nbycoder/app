# Calculator app using React JS

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

This project was made following WebDevSimplified's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgRrrOt0Vr8).

This project was a way to learn and apply the **useReducer hook**! It was a fun and quick project that I might even revisit in the future!
